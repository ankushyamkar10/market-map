## Assumptions  

- The app is designed to visualize cryptocurrency order books using Binance's WebSocket API.  
- Data is streamed for a specific trading pair (default: BTC/USDT).  
- The app assumes the structure of Binance's depth data (`bids` and `asks` are arrays of `[price, quantity]`).  

---

## Additional Setup  

- Ensure a stable internet connection for consuming real-time WebSocket data.  
- Binance WebSocket API endpoint: `wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/{pair}@depth10@100ms`  
  - Replace `{pair}` with your desired trading pair (e.g., `btcusdt`).
